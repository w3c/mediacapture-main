    <p>This document defines a set of JavaScript APIs that allow local media,

  </section>
  <section id="sotd">
    <p>This document is not complete. The API is based on preliminary work done in the

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document defines APIs for requesting access to local multimedia
    devices, such as microphones or video cameras.</p>
    <p>This document also defines the MediaStream API, which provides the means
    to control where multimedia stream data is consumed, and provides some
    control over the devices that produce the media. It also exposes
    information about devices able to capture and render media.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>User Agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]] to implement the APIs
    defined in this specification must implement them in a manner consistent
    with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification
    [[WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that specification and
    terminology.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn data-export>source</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A source is the "thing" providing the source of a media stream
        track. The source is the broadcaster of the media itself. A source can
        be a physical webcam, microphone, local video or audio file from the
        user's hard drive, network resource, or static image. Note that this
        document describes the use of microphone and camera type sources only,
        the use of other source types is described in other documents.</p>
        <p>An application that has no prior authorization regarding sources is
        only given the number of available sources, their type and any
        relationship to other devices. Additional information about sources can
        become available when applications are authorized to use a source (see
        <a href="#access-control-model"></a>).</p>
        <p>Sources <strong>do not</strong> have constraints — tracks have
        constraints. When a source is connected to a track, it must produce
        media that conforms to the constraints present on that track, to that
        track. Multiple tracks can be attached to the same source. User Agent
        processing, such as downsampling, MAY be used to ensure that all tracks
        have appropriate media.</p>
        <p>Sources have constrainable properties which have
        [=capabilities=] and [=settings=]
        exposed on tracks. While the constrainable properties are "owned" by
        the source, sources MAY be able to accomodate different demands at
        once. For this reason, capabilities are common to any (multiple) tracks
        that happen to be using the same source, whereas settings MAY differ
        per track (e.g., if two different track objects bound to the same
        source query capability and settings information, they will get back
        the same capabilities, but may get different settings that are tailored
        to satisfy their individual constraints).</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn data-lt=settings>Setting</dfn> (Source Setting)</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A setting refers to the immediate, current
        value of the source's constrainable properties. Settings are always
        read-only.</p>
        <p>A source conditions may dynamically change, such as when a camera
        switches to a lower frame rate due to low light conditions. In these
        cases the tracks related to the affected source might not satisfy the
        set constraints any longer. The platform SHOULD try to minimize such
        excursions as far as possible, but will continue to deliver media even
        when a temporary or permanent condition exists that prevents satisfying
        the constraints.</p>
        <p>Although settings are a property of the source, they are only
        exposed to the application through the tracks attached to the source.
        This is exposed via the <a>ConstrainablePattern</a> interface.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn data-lt=capabilities>Capability</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>For each constrainable property, there is a capability that
        describes whether it is supported by the source and if so, the range of
        supported values. As with settings, capabilities are exposed to the
        application via the <a>ConstrainablePattern</a> interface.</p>
        <p>The values of the supported capabilities must be normalized to the
        ranges and enumerated types defined in this specification.</p>
        <p>A {{MediaStreamTrack/getCapabilities()}} call on
        a track returns the same underlying per-source capabilities for all
        tracks connected to the source.</p>
        <p>Source capabilities are effectively constant. Applications should be
        able to depend on a specific source having the same capabilities for
        any browsing session.</p>
        <p>This API is intentionally simplified. Capabilities are not capable
        of describing interactions between different values. For instance, it
        is not possible to accurately describe the capabilities of a camera
        that can produce a high resolution video stream at a low frame rate and
        lower resolutions at a higher frame rate. Capabilities describe the
        complete range of each value. Interactions between constraints are
        exposed by attempting to apply constraints.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><dfn>Constraint</dfn>s</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Constraints provide a general control surface that allows
        applications to both select an appropriate source for a track and, once
        selected, to influence how a source operates.</p>
        <p>Constraints limit the range of operating modes that a source can use
        when providing media for a track. Without provided track constraints,
        implementations are free to select a source's settings from the full
        ranges of its supported capabilities. Implementations may also adjust
        source settings at any time within the bounds imposed by all applied
        constraints.</p>
        <p>{{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} uses constraints
        to help select an appropriate source for a track and configure it.
        Additionally, the <a>ConstrainablePattern</a> interface on tracks
        includes an API for dynamically changing the track's constraints at any
        later time.</p>
        <p>A track will not be connected to a source using
        {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} if its initial constraints cannot be
        satisfied. However, the ability to meet the constraints on a track can
        change over time, and constraints can be changed. If circumstances
        change such that constraints cannot be met, the
        <a>ConstrainablePattern</a> interface defines an appropriate error to
        inform the application. <a href=
        "#the-model-sources-sinks-constraints-and-settings"></a> explains how
        constraints interact in more detail.</p>
        <p>For each constrainable property, a constraint exists whose name
        corresponds with the relevant source setting name and capability
        name.</p>
        <p>A constraint falls into one of three groups, depending on its place
        in the constraints structure. The groups are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><dfn>required constraints</dfn> are all <a data-lt=
          "advanced constraints">non-advanced</a> constraints that are
        <a>required</a>.</li>
          <li><dfn>optional basic constraints</dfn> are the remaining
        <a data-lt="advanced constraints">non-advanced</a> constraints.</li>
          <li><dfn>advanced constraints</dfn> are all constraints specified
        using the <code><a href="#dom-constraints-advanced">advanced</a></code>
        keyword.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general, User Agents will have more flexibility to optimize the
        media streaming experience the fewer constraints are applied, so
        application authors are strongly encouraged to use <a>required
        constraints</a> sparingly.</p>

    <h2>MediaStream API</h2>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The two main components in the MediaStream API are the
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} and {{MediaStream}} interfaces. The
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} object represents media of a single
      type that originates from one media source in the User Agent, e.g. video
      produced by a web camera. A {{MediaStream}} is used to
      group several {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects into one unit
      that can be recorded or rendered in a media element.</p>
      <p>Each {{MediaStream}} can contain zero or more
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects. All tracks in a
      {{MediaStream}} are intended to be synchronized when
      rendered. This is not a hard requirement, since it might not be possible
      to synchronize tracks from sources that have different clocks. Different
      {{MediaStream}} objects do not need to be
      synchronized.</p>
      <p class="note">While the intent is to synchronize tracks, it could be
      better in some circumstances to permit tracks to lose synchronization. In
      particular, when tracks are remotely sourced and real-time [[?WEBRTC]],
      it can be better to allow loss of synchronization than to accumulate
      delays or risk glitches and other artifacts. Implementations are expected
      to understand the implications of choices regarding synchronization of
      playback and the effect that these have on user perception.</p>
      <p>A single {{MediaStreamTrack}} can represent
      multi-channel content, such as stereo or 5.1 audio or stereoscopic video,
      where the channels have a well defined relationship to each other.
      Information about channels might be exposed through other APIs, such as
      [[?WEBAUDIO]], but this specification provides no direct access to
      channels.</p>
      <p>A {{MediaStream}} object has an input and an output
      that represent the combined input and output of all the object's tracks.
      The output of the {{MediaStream}} controls how the object
      is rendered, e.g., what is saved if the object is recorded to a file or
      what is displayed if the object is used in a [^video^] element.
      A single {{MediaStream}} object can be attached to
      multiple different outputs at the same time.</p>
      <p>A new {{MediaStream}} object can be created from
      existing media streams or tracks using the
      {{MediaStream/MediaStream()}} constructor. The constructor argument
      can either be an existing {{MediaStream}} object, in
      which case all the tracks of the given stream are added to the new
      {{MediaStream}} object, or an array of
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects. The latter form makes it
      possible to compose a stream from different source streams.</p>
      <p>Both {{MediaStream}} and
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects can be cloned. A cloned
      {{MediaStream}} contains clones of all member tracks from
      the original stream. A cloned {{MediaStreamTrack}} has a
      <a href="#constrainable-interface">set of constraints</a> that is
      independent of the instance it is cloned from, which allows media from
      the same source to have different constraints applied for different
      <a>consumer</a>s. The {{MediaStream}} object is also used in
      contexts outside {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia}}, such as [[?WEBRTC]].</p>

      <h2>{{MediaStream}}</h2>
      <p id=
      "mediastream-constructor">The MediaStream <dfn data-idl data-dfn-for=MediaStream>constructor</dfn> composes a new
      stream out of existing tracks. It takes an optional argument of type
      {{MediaStream}} or an array of
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects. When the constructor is invoked, the User
      Agent must run the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Let <var>stream</var> be a newly constructed
          {{MediaStream}} object.</p>

        <li>
          <p>If the constructor's argument is present, run the following
          steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>

                  set</a>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>A sequence of {{MediaStreamTrack}}
                  objects:</p>

                  {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects in the provided
                  sequence.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For each {{MediaStreamTrack}},
              <var>track</var> , in <var>tracks</var>, run the following
              steps:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>If <var>track</var> is already in <var>stream</var>'s
                  <a href="#track-set">track set</a>, skip
                  <var>track</var>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Otherwise, add <var>track</var> to <var>stream</var>'s
                  <a href="#track-set">track set</a>.</p>
                </li>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Return <var>stream</var>.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The tracks of a {{MediaStream}} are stored in a
      <dfn id="track-set" data-export>track set</dfn>. The track set MUST contain the
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects that correspond to the
      tracks of the stream. The relative order of the tracks in the set is User
      Agent defined and the API will never put any requirements on the order.
      The proper way to find a specific {{MediaStreamTrack}}
      object in the set is to look it up by its {{MediaStreamTrack/id}}.</p>
      <p>An object that reads data from the output of a
      {{MediaStream}} is referred to as a
      {{MediaStream}} <dfn data-export data-for=MediaStream>consumer</dfn>. The list of
      {{MediaStream}} consumers currently include media
      elements (such as [^video^] and
      [^audio^]) [[HTML]], Web Real-Time Communications
      (WebRTC; {{RTCPeerConnection}}) [[?WEBRTC]], media recording
      (<code class=fixme>MediaRecorder</code>) [[?mediastream-recording]], image capture
      (<code class=fixme>ImageCapture</code>) [[?image-capture]], and web audio
      ({{MediaStreamAudioSourceNode}}) [[?WEBAUDIO]].</p>
      <p class="note">{{MediaStream}} consumers must be able to
      handle tracks being added and removed. This behavior is specified per
      consumer.</p>
      <p>A {{MediaStream}} object is said to be <dfn data-dfn-for="stream" id=
      "stream-active">active</dfn> when it has at least one
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} that has not [= track/ended =]. A {{MediaStream}} that does not
      have any tracks or only has tracks that are [= track/ended =]
      is <dfn data-dfn-for="stream" id="stream-inactive">inactive</dfn>.</p>
      <p>A {{MediaStream}} object is said to be <dfn data-dfn-for=stream id=
      "stream-audible" data-dfn-for=stream>audible</dfn> when it has at least one
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} whose {{MediaStreamTrack/[[Kind]]}} is <a>"audio"</a>
      that has not [= track/ended =]. A {{MediaStream}} that does not have any
      audio tracks or only has audio tracks that are [= track/ended =] is
      <dfn id="stream-inaudible" data-dfn-for=stream>inaudible</dfn>.</p>
      <p>The User Agent may update a {{MediaStream}}'s <a href=
      "#track-set">track set</a> in response to, for example, an external
      event. This specification does not specify any such cases, but other
      specifications using the MediaStream API may. One such example is the
      WebRTC 1.0 [[?WEBRTC]] specification where the <a href=
      "#track-set">track set</a> of a {{MediaStream}}, received
      from another peer, can be updated as a result of changes to the media
      session.</p>
      <p>To <dfn id="add-track">add a track</dfn> <var>track</var> to a
      {{MediaStream}} <var>stream</var>, the User Agent MUST
      run the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If <var>track</var> is already in <var>stream's</var> <a href=
          "#track-set">track set</a>, then abort these steps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Add <var>track</var> to <var>stream</var>'s <a href=
          "#track-set">track set</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Fire a track event named {{addtrack}} with
          <var>track</var> at <var>stream</var>.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To <dfn id="remove-track">remove a track</dfn> <var>track</var> from a
      {{MediaStream}} <var>stream</var>, the User Agent MUST
      run the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If <var>track</var> is not in <var>stream's</var> <a href=

              <p>When a {{MediaStream}} is created, the User
              Agent MUST generate an identifier string, and MUST initialize the
              object's {{id}}
              attribute to that string, unless the object is created as part of
              a special purpose algorithm that specifies how the stream id must
              be initialized. A good practice is to use a UUID [[rfc4122]],
              which is 36 characters long in its canonical form. To avoid
              fingerprinting, implementations SHOULD use the forms in section
              4.4 or 4.5 of RFC 4122 when generating UUIDs.</p>
              <p>An example of an algorithm that specifies how the stream id

      <h2>{{MediaStreamTrack}}</h2>
      <p>A {{MediaStreamTrack}} object represents a media
      source in the User Agent. An example source is a device connected to the
      User Agent. Other specifications may define sources for
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} that override the behavior specified
      here. Several {{MediaStreamTrack}} objects can represent
      the same media source, e.g., when the user chooses the same camera in the
      UI shown by two consecutive calls to {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}.</p>
      <p>The data from a {{MediaStreamTrack}} object does not
      necessarily have a canonical binary form; for example, it could just be
      "the video currently coming from the user's video camera". This allows
      User Agents to manipulate media in whatever fashion is most suitable on
      the user's platform.</p>
      <p>A script can indicate that a {{MediaStreamTrack}}
      object no longer needs its source with the {{MediaStreamTrack/stop()}}
      method. When all tracks
      using a source have been stopped or ended by some other means, the source
      is <dfn id="source-stopped" data-lt="source stopped state">stopped</dfn>. If the source is a device
      exposed by {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}, then when
      the source is stopped, the UA MUST run the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Let <var>deviceId</var> be the device's {{MediaDeviceInfo/deviceId}}.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set {{MediaDevices/[[devicesLiveMap]]}}[<var>deviceId</var>] to
          <code>false</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If the [=permission state=]
          of the permission associated with the device's kind and
          <var>deviceId</var>, is not {{PermissionState/"granted"}}, then set
          {{MediaDevices/[[devicesAccessibleMap]]}}[<var>deviceId</var>] to
          <code>false</code>.</p>
        </li>

        <h3>Life-cycle and Media Flow</h3>
        <h4>Life-cycle</h4>
        <p>A {{MediaStreamTrack}} has two states in its
        life-cycle: live and ended. A newly created
        {{MediaStreamTrack}} can be in either state depending
        on how it was created. For example, cloning an ended track results in a
        new ended track. The current state is reflected by the object's
        {{MediaStreamTrack/readyState}}
        attribute.</p>
        <p>In the live state, the track is active and media is
        available for use by consumers (but may be replaced by
        zero-information-content if the {{MediaStreamTrack}} is
        [= muted =]  or [= enabled | disabled =], see below).</p>
        <p>A muted or disabled {{MediaStreamTrack}} renders
        either silence (audio), black frames (video), or a
        zero-information-content equivalent. For example, a video element
        sourced by a muted or disabled {{MediaStreamTrack}}
        (contained within a {{MediaStream}} ), is playing but
        the rendered content is the muted output.</p>
        <p>If the source is a device exposed by {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}},
        then when a track becomes either
        muted or disabled, and this brings all tracks connected to the device
        to be either muted, disabled, or stopped, then the UA MAY, using the
        device's {{MediaDeviceInfo/deviceId}}, <var>deviceId</var>, set
        {{MediaDevices/[[devicesLiveMap]]}}[<var>deviceId</var>] to <code>false</code>,
        provided the UA sets it back to <code>true</code> as soon as any
        unstopped track connected to this device becomes un-muted or enabled
        again.</p>
        <p>When a {{MediaStreamTrackState/"live"}}, [= track/muted | unmuted =], and
        [= track/enabled =] track sourced by a device exposed
        by {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} becomes either
        [= track/muted or [= track/enabled | disabled =],
        and this brings <em>all</em> tracks connected to the device (regardless
        of browsing context) to be either
        muted, disabled, or stopped, then the UA SHOULD relinquish the device
        within 3 seconds while allowing time for a reasonably-observant user to
        become aware of the transition. The UA SHOULD attempt to reacquire the
        device as soon as any live track sourced by the device
        becomes both [= track/muted | unmuted =] and
        [= track/enabled =] again, provided that track's
        [=relevant settings object=]'s [=environment settings object/responsible document=]
        <a data-cite="!HTML/#gains-focus">has focus</a> at that time. If the
        document does not <a data-cite="!HTML/#gains-focus">have focus</a> at that time,
        the UA SHOULD instead queue a task to <a data-lt=muted>mute</a> the
        track, and not queue a task to <a data-lt=muted>unmute</a> it until
        the document <a data-cite="!HTML/#gains-focus">regains focus</a>.
        If reacquiring the device fails, the UA MUST
        [= track ended by the User agent | end the track =] (The UA MAY end it earlier
        should it detect a device problem, like the device being physically
        removed).</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>The intent is to give users the assurance of privacy that having
          physical camera (and microphone) hardware lights off brings, by
          aligning physical and logical “privacy indicators”, at least while the
          current document is the sole user of a device.</p>
          <p>While other applications and documents using the device
          simultaneously may interfere with this intent at times, they do not
          interfere with the rules laid forth.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The muted/unmuted state of a track reflects whether the source
        provides any media at this moment. The enabled/disabled state is under
        application control and determines whether the track outputs media (to
        its consumers). Hence, media from the source only flows when a
        {{MediaStreamTrack}} object is both unmuted and
        enabled.</p>
        <p>A {{MediaStreamTrack}} is [= track/muted =]
        when the source is temporarily unable to
        provide the track with data. A track can be muted by a user. Often this
        action is outside the control of the application. This could be as a
        result of the user hitting a hardware switch or toggling a control in
        the operating system / User Agent chrome. A track can also be muted by the
        User Agent.</p>
        <p>Applications are able to [= track/enabled | enable =] or
        disable a {{MediaStreamTrack}} to prevent it from
        rendering media from the source. A muted track will however, regardless
        of the enabled state, render silence and blackness. A disabled track is
        logically equivalent to a muted track, from a consumer point of
        view.</p>
        <p>For a newly created {{MediaStreamTrack}} object, the
        following applies. The track is always enabled unless stated otherwise
        (for example when cloned) and the muted state reflects the state of the
        source at the time the track is created.</p>
        <p>A {{MediaStreamTrack}} object is said to
        <em>end</em> when the source of the track is disconnected or
        exhausted.</p>
        <p>If all {{MediaStreamTrack}}s that are using the same
        source are [= track/ended =], the source will be
        [= source/stopped =].</p>
        <p>When a {{MediaStreamTrack}} object ends for any
        reason (e.g., because the user rescinds the permission for the page to
        use the local camera, or because the application invoked the
        {{MediaStreamTrack/stop()}} method on
        the {{MediaStreamTrack}} object, or because the User
        Agent has instructed the track to end for any reason) it is said to be

          <li>
            <p>If <var>track</var>'s {{MediaStreamTrack/[[ReadyState]]}}

          <li>
            <p>Set <var>track</var>'s {{MediaStreamTrack/[[ReadyState]]}}
            to {{MediaStreamTrackState/"ended"}}.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Notify <var>track</var>'s source that <var>track</var> is
            [= track/ended =] so that the source may be [= source/stopped =], unless other

        source for this event is the user interaction event source.</p>
        <p>To invoke the <dfn data-export="">device permission revocation algorithm</dfn> with

            {{MediaStreamTrackState/"live"}} <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s
            that fit the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If <var>deviceId</var> is not <code>undefined</code>, tracks

          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Media Flow</h4>
        <p>There are two dimensions related to the media flow for a
        {{MediaStreamTrackState/"live"}} {{MediaStreamTrack}} : muted / not
        muted, and enabled / disabled.</p>
        <p><dfn data-export id=
        "track-muted">Muted</dfn> refers to the input to the
        {{MediaStreamTrack}}. If live samples are not made
        available to the {{MediaStreamTrack}} it is muted.</p>
        <p>{{Muted}} is outside the control of web applications, but can be observed by
        the application by reading the {{MediaStreamTrack/muted}} attribute and listening
        to the associated events {{mute}} and {{unmute}}. There can be
        several reasons for a {{MediaStreamTrack}} to be muted:
        the user pushing a physical mute button on the microphone, the user
        closing a laptop lid with an embedded camera, the user toggling a
        control in the operating system, the user clicking a mute button in the
        User Agent chrome, the User Agent (on behalf of the user) mutes, etc.</p>
        <p>On some operating systems, microphone access may
        get stolen from the User Agent when another application with higher-audio priority gets access to it,
        for instance in case of an incoming phone call on mobile OS. The User Agent SHOULD provide
        this information to the web application through {{MediaStreamTrack/muted}} and
        its associated events.</p>

        <p>Whenever the User Agent initiates such a change, it MUST queue a
        task, using the user interaction task source, to [=set a track's muted
        state=] to the state desired by the user.</p>
        task, using the user interaction task source, to [=set a track's muted
        state=] to the state desired by the user.</p>
        <p>To <dfn data-export id="set-track-muted">set a track's muted state</dfn> to
        <var>newState</var>, the User Agent MUST run the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let <var>track</var> be the {{MediaStreamTrack}} in
            question.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If <var>track</var>.{{MediaStreamTrack/[[Muted]]}} is already
            <var>newState</var>, then abort these steps.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Set <var>track</var>.{{MediaStreamTrack/[[Muted]]}} to
            <var>newState</var>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If <var>newState</var> is <code>true</code> let
            <var>eventName</var> be {{mute}}, otherwise
            {{unmute}}.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>[=Fire an event=] named <var>eventName</var> on
            <var>track</var>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><dfn data-export id="track-enabled" data-lt="track enabled state|enabled" data-lt-noDefault>Enabled/disabled</dfn> on the other hand is
        available to the application to control (and observe) via the
        {{MediaStreamTrack/enabled}}
        attribute.</p>
        <p>The result for the consumer is the same in the sense that whenever
        {{MediaStreamTrack}} is muted or disabled (or both) the
        consumer gets zero-information-content, which means silence for audio
        and black frames for video. In other words, media from the source only
        flows when a {{MediaStreamTrack}} object is both
        unmuted and enabled. For example, a video element sourced by a muted or
        disabled {{MediaStreamTrack}} (contained in a
        {{MediaStream}} ), is playing but rendering
        blackness.</p>
        <p>For a newly created {{MediaStreamTrack}} object, the
        following applies: the track is always enabled unless stated otherwise
        (for example when cloned) and the muted state reflects the state of the
        source at the time the track is created.</p>

        <h3>Tracks and Constraints</h3>
        <p>{{MediaStreamTrack}} is a <a>constrainable
        object</a> as defined in the <a href=
        "#constrainable-interface">Constrainable Pattern</a> section.
        Constraints are set on tracks and may affect sources.</p>
        <p>Whether <code><a>Constraints</a></code> were provided at track
        initialization time or need to be established later at runtime, the

        retrieval and manipulation of the constraints currently established on
        a track.</p>

                {{MediaDeviceInfo.deviceId}}.
                Note that the setting of this property is
                uniquely determined by the source that is attached to the
                {{MediaStreamTrack}}. In particular, {{MediaStreamTrack/getCapabilities()}} will return only a
                single value for deviceId. This property can therefore be used
                for initial media selection with {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}. However, it is not useful
                for subsequent media control with {{MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints()}}, since any attempt to
                set a different value will result in an unsatisfiable
                <a>ConstraintSet</a>.
                If a string of length 0 is used as a deviceId value constraint

                between browsing sessions, its usefulness for initial media
                selection with {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} is limited. It is not useful

    <h2>The model: sources, sinks, constraints, and settings</h2>
    <p>User Agents provide a media pipeline from sources to sinks. In a User Agent,
    sinks are the &lt;[^img^]&gt;, &lt;[^video^]&gt;, and &lt;[^audio^]&gt; tags.
    Traditional sources include streamed content, files, and web resources. The
    media produced by these sources typically does not change over time - these
    sources can be considered to be static.</p>
    <p>The sinks that display these sources to the user (the actual tags
    themselves) have a variety of controls for manipulating the source content.
    For example, an &lt;[^img^]&gt; tag scales down a huge source image of
    1600x1200 pixels to fit in a rectangle defined with
    <code>width="400"</code> and <code>height="300"</code>.</p>
    <p>Sources have a lifetime. By default, a source lifetime is tied
    to the context that created it. For instance, sources created
    by {{MediaDevices.getUserMedia()}} are considered as created
    by its navigator.{{mediaDevices}} context.
    Similarly, sources of {{RTCRtpReceiver}} objects are bound
    to the {{RTCPeerConnection}} itself, which is bound to its creation context.
    Except if stated explicitly in the definition of specific sources,
    a source is always [= source/stopped =] when its creation context goes away.
    It should be noted that two sources of different contexts
    may use the same capture device at the same time.
    One source can be stopped independently of the other one.
    </p>
    <p>The getUserMedia API adds dynamic sources such as microphones and
    cameras - the characteristics of these sources can change in response to
    application needs. These sources can be considered to be dynamic in nature.
    A &lt;[^video^]&gt; element that displays media from a dynamic source can
    either perform scaling or it can feed back information along the media
    pipeline and have the source produce content more suitable for display.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This sort of feedback loop is obviously just
      enabling an "optimization", but it's a non-trivial gain. This
      optimization can save battery, allow for less network congestion,
      etc...</p>
    </div>
    <p>Note that {{MediaStream}} sinks (such as
    &lt;[^video^]&gt;, &lt;[^audio^]&gt;, and even
    {{RTCPeerConnection}}) will continue to have mechanisms to further
    transform the source stream beyond that which the <a>Settings</a>,
    <a>Capabilities</a>, and <a>Constraints</a> described in this specification
    offer. (The sink transformation options, including those of
    {{RTCPeerConnection}}, are outside the scope of this
    specification.)</p>
    <p>The act of changing or applying a track constraint may affect the
    [=settings=] of all tracks sharing that source and
    consequently all down-level sinks that are using that source. Many sinks
    may be able to take these changes in stride, such as the
    <code>&lt;[^video^]&gt;</code> element or {{RTCPeerConnection}}.
    Others like the Recorder API may fail as a result of a source setting
    change.</p>
    <p>The {{RTCPeerConnection}} is an interesting object because it
    acts simultaneously as both a sink <strong>and</strong> a source for
    over-the-network streams. As a sink, it has source transformational
    capabilities (e.g., lowering bit-rates, scaling-up / down resolutions, and
    adjusting frame-rates), and as a source it could have its own settings
    changed by a track source.</p>
    <p>To illustrate how changes to a given source impact various sinks,
    consider the following example. This example only uses width and height,
    but the same principles apply to all of the <a>Settings</a> exposed in this
    specification. In the first figure a home client has obtained a video
    source from its local video camera. The source's width and height settings
    are 800 pixels and 600 pixels, respectively. Three
    {{MediaStream}} objects on the home client contain tracks
    that use this same <{{MediaStreamTrack/deviceId}}. The three media streams
    are connected to three different sinks: a <code>&lt;[^video^]&gt;</code>
    element (A), another <code>&lt;[^video^]&gt;</code> element (B), and a peer
    connection (C). The peer connection is streaming the source video to a
    remote client. On the remote client there are two media streams with tracks
    that use the peer connection as a source. These two media streams are
    connected to two <code>&lt;[^video^]&gt;</code> element sinks (Y and
    Z).</p><img alt=
    "Changing media stream source effects: before the requested change" src=
    "images/change_states_before.svg">
    <p>Note that at this moment, all of the sinks on the home client must apply
    a transformation to the original source's provided dimension settings. B is
    scaling the video down, A is scaling the video up (resulting in loss of
    quality), and C is also scaling the video up slightly for sending over the
    network. On the remote client, sink Y is scaling the video <em>way</em>
    down, while sink Z is not applying any scaling.</p>
    <p>In response to {{MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints()}} being called, one of the
    tracks wants a higher resolution (1920 by 1200 pixels) from the home
    client's video source.</p><img alt=
    "Changing media stream source effects: after the requested change" src=
    "images/change_states_after.svg">
    <p>Note that the source change immediately affects all of the tracks and
    sinks on the home client, but does not impact any of the sinks (or sources)
    on the remote client. With the increase in the home client source video's
    dimensions, sink A no longer has to perform any scaling, while sink B must
    scale down even further than before. Sink C (the peer connection) must now
    scale down the video in order to keep the transmission constant to the
    remote client.</p>
    <p>While not shown, an equally valid settings change request could be made
    on the remote client's side. In addition to impacting sink Y and Z in the
    same manner as A, B and C were impacted earlier, it could lead to
    re-negotiation with the peer connection on the home client in order to
    alter the transformation that it is applying to the home client's video
    source. Such a change is NOT REQUIRED to change anything related to sink A
    or B or the home client's video source.</p>
    <p>Note that this specification does not define a mechanism by which a
    change to the remote client's video source could automatically trigger a
    change to the home client's video source. Implementations may choose to
    make such source-to-sink optimizations as long as they only do so within
    the constraints established by the application, as the next example
    demonstrates.</p>
    <p>It is fairly obvious that changes to a given source will impact sink
    consumers. However, in some situations changes to a given sink may also
    cause implementations to adjust a source's settings. This is illustrated in
    the following figures. In the first figure below, the home client's video
    source is sending a video stream sized at 1920 by 1200 pixels. The video
    source is also unconstrained, such that the exact source dimensions are
    flexible as far as the application is concerned. Two
    {{MediaStream}} objects contain tracks with the same
    {{MediaStreamTrack/deviceId}}, and those {{MediaStream}}s
    are connected to two different <code>&lt;[^video^]&gt;</code> element sinks A
    and B. Sink A has been sized to <code>width="1920"</code> and
    <code>height="1200"</code> and is displaying the source's video content
    without any transformations. Sink B has been sized smaller and, as a
    result, is scaling the video down to fit its rectangle of 320 pixels across
    by 200 pixels down.</p><img alt=
    "Changing media stream sinks may affect sources: before the requested change"
    src="images/change_states_before2.svg">
    <p>When the application changes sink A to a smaller dimension (from 1920 to
    1024 pixels wide and from 1200 to 768 pixels tall), the User Agent's media
    pipeline may recognize that none of its sinks require the higher source
    resolution, and needless work is being done both on the part of the source
    and sink A. In such a case and without any other constraints forcing the
    source to continue producing the higher resolution video, the media
    pipeline MAY change the source resolution:</p><img alt=
    "Changing media stream sinks may affect sources: after the requested change"
    src="images/change_states_after2.svg">
    <p>In the above figure, the home client's video source resolution was
    changed to the greater of that from sink A and B in order to optimize
    playback. While not shown above, the same behavior could apply to peer
    connections and other sinks.</p>
    <p>It is possible that <a>constraints</a> can be applied to a track which a
    source is unable to satisfy, either because the source itself cannot
    satisfy the constraint or because the source is already satisfying a
    conflicting constraint. When this happens, the promise returned from
    {{MediaStreamTrack/applyConstraints()}}
    will be <a>rejected</a>, without applying any of the new constraints. Since
    no change in constraints occurs in this case, there is also no required
    change to the source itself as a result of this condition. Here is an
    example of this behavior.</p>
    <p>In this example, two media streams each have a video track that share
    the same source. The first track initially has no constraints applied. It
    is connected to sink N. Sink N has a resolution of 800 by 600 pixels and is
    scaling down the source's resolution of 1024 by 768 to fit. The other track
    has a <a data-lt="required constraints">required constraint</a> forcing off
    the source's fill light; it is connected to sink P. Sink P has a width and
    height equal to that of the source.</p>
    <p><img alt="Overconstrained application" src=
    "images/overconstrained_apply.svg"></p>
    <p>Now, the first track adds a
    <a data-lt="required constraints">required constraint</a> that the fill light
    should be forced on. At this point, both <a>required constraints</a> cannot be
    satisfied by the source (the fill light cannot be simultaneously on and off
    at the same time). Since this state was caused by the first track's attempt
    to apply a conflicting constraint, the constraint application fails and
    there is no change in the source's settings nor to the constraints on
    either track.</p>

    <a data-cite="!HTML/#media-timeline">media timeline</a>. The timeline
    starts at 0 and increments linearly in real time as long as the
    media element is <a data-cite="!HTML/#potentially-playing">
    potentially playing</a>. The timeline does not increment when
    the playout of the {{MediaStream}} is paused.</p>
    <p>User Agents that support this specification MUST support the
    {{HTMLMediaElement/srcObject}}
    attribute of the {{HTMLMediaElement}} interface defined in
    [[HTML]], which includes support for playing {{MediaStream}}
    objects.</p>
    <p>The [[HTML]] document outlines how the {{HTMLMediaElement}}
    works with a <em>media provider object</em>. The following applies when the
    <em>media provider object</em> is a {{MediaStream}}:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Whenever an {{AudioTrack}}
        or a {{VideoTrack}}
        is created, the <code>id</code> and <code>label</code> attributes must
        be initialized to the corresponding attributes of the
        {{MediaStreamTrack}}, the <code>kind</code> attribute must be
        initialized to <code>"main"</code> and the <code>language</code> attribute to the
        empty string</p>
      </li>
      <li>The User Agent MUST always play the current data from the
      {{MediaStream}} and MUST NOT buffer.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the order in the {{MediaStream}} 's [=track set=] is undefined, no requirements are put on how
        the {{AudioTrackList}}
        and {{VideoTrackList}}
        is ordered</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the element is an {{HTMLVideoElement}}, then it is said
        to have <a data-cite="!HTML/#ended-playback">ended playback</a> when it

        (i.e. {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} was not called or never resolved successfully), the

        <p>Otherwise, the

              In [=nested browsing contexts=],
              the decision of whether or not the identifier is the same across
              documents, MUST follow the User Agent's partitioning rules for
              storage (such as {{WindowLocalStorage/localStorage}}), if any,
              to not interfere with mitigations for cross-site correlation.
              If the identifier can uniquely
              identify the user, then it MUST be un-guessable in documents from
              other origins to prevent the identifier from being used to
              correlate the same user across different origins. An identifier
              can be reused across origins as long as it is not tied to the user
              and can be guessed by other means, like the User-Agent string.</p>

              MUST be persisted, except as detailed below. Unique and stable
              identifiers let the application save, identify the availability
              of, and directly request specific sources, across multiple

              <p>However, as long as no local device has been attached to a
              live MediaStreamTrack in a page from this origin, and no [=stored permission=] to access local
              devices has been granted to this origin, then the User Agent MAY
              clear this identifier once the last browsing session from this
              origin has been closed. If the User Agent chooses not to clear
              the identifier in this condition, then it MUST provide for the
              user to visibly inspect and delete the identifier, like a
              cookie.</p>
              <p class="fingerprint">Since {{deviceId}} may persist
              across browsing sessions and to reduce its potential as a

              as other persistent storage mechanisms such as cookies
              [[COOKIES]], in that User Agents MUST NOT persist device
              identifiers for sites that are blocked from using cookies, and
              User Agents MUST rotate per-origin device identifiers when other
              persistent storage are cleared.</p>

    <h2>Obtaining local multimedia content</h2>
    <p>This section extends {{Navigator}} and
    {{MediaDevices}} with APIs to request permission to access
    media input devices available to the User Agent.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, a local {{MediaStream}} can be captured

      <h3>Legacy Interface Extensions</h3>
      <div class="note">
        The definition of getUserMedia() in this section reflects two major
        changes from the method definition that has existed here for many
        months.
        <p>First, the official definition for the getUserMedia() method, and
        the one which developers are encouraged to use, is now at {{MediaDevices}}. This decision
        reflected consensus as long as the original API remained available here
        under the Navigator object for backwards compatibility reasons, since
        the working group acknowledges that early users of these APIs have been
        encouraged to define getUserMedia as "var getUserMedia =
        navigator.getUserMedia || navigator.webkitGetUserMedia ||
        navigator.mozGetUserMedia;" in order for their code to be functional
        both before and after official implementations of getUserMedia() in
        popular User Agents. To ensure functional equivalence, the getUserMedia()
        method here is defined in terms of the method under MediaDevices.</p>
        <p>Second, the decision to change all other callback-based methods in
        the specification to be based on Promises instead required that the
        navigator.getUserMedia() definition reflect this in its use of
        navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(). Because navigator.getUserMedia()
        is now the only callback-based method remaining in the specification,
        there is ongoing discussion as to a) whether it still belongs in the
        specification, and b) if it does, whether its syntax should remain
        callback-based or change in some way to use Promises. Input on these
        questions is encouraged, particularly from developers actively using
        today's implementations of this functionality.</p>
        <p>Note that the other methods that changed from a callback-based
        syntax to a Promises-based syntax were not considered to have been
        implemented widely enough in any form to have to consider legacy
        usage.</p>

      <h3>{{MediaDevices}} Interface Extensions</h3>
      <div class="note">
        The definition of {{Navigator/getUserMedia()}} in this section reflects two major
        changes from the method definition that has existed under {{Navigator}} for
        many months.
        <p>First, the official definition for the {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} method, and
        the one which developers are encouraged to use, is now the one defined
        here under {{MediaDevices}}. This decision reflected consensus as long as
        the original API remained available at <a>Navigator.getUserMedia</a>
        under the {{Navigator}} object for backwards compatibility reasons, since
        the working group acknowledges that early users of these APIs have been
        encouraged to define getUserMedia as "var getUserMedia =
        navigator.getUserMedia || navigator.webkitGetUserMedia ||
        navigator.mozGetUserMedia;" in order for their code to be functional
        both before and after official implementations of getUserMedia() in
        popular User Agents. To ensure functional equivalence, the getUserMedia()
        method under {{Navigator}} is defined in terms of the method here.</p>
        <p>Second, the method defined here is Promises-based, while the one
        defined under {{Navigator}} is currently still callback-based. Developers
        expecting to find getUserMedia() defined under Navigator are strongly
        encouraged to read the detailed Note given there.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The {{MediaDevices/getSupportedConstraints}} method is provided to allow
      the application to determine which constraints the User Agent
      recognizes. Applications may need this information to use
      <a>required constraints</a> reliably or get predictable results from
      combinatory logic in <a>advanced constraints</a>.</p>
      <div>
        <pre class="idl"

  MediaTrackSupportedConstraints getSupportedConstraints();
  Promise&lt;MediaStream&gt; getUserMedia(optional MediaStreamConstraints constraints = {});
};</pre>

            <dt><dfn>getSupportedConstraints</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Returns a dictionary whose members are the constrainable
              properties known to the User Agent. A supported constrainable
              property MUST be represented and any constrainable properties not
              supported by the User Agent MUST NOT be present in the returned
              dictionary. The values returned represent what the User Agent
              implements and will not change during a browsing session.</p>

              <p>Prompts the user for permission to use their Web cam or other
              video or audio input.</p>
              <p>The <var>constraints</var> argument is a dictionary of type
              {{MediaStreamConstraints}}.</p>
              <p>This method returns a promise. The promise will be
              [=upon fulfillment|fulfilled=] with a suitable {{MediaStream}}
              object if the user accepts valid tracks as described below.</p>
              <p>The promise will be <a>rejected</a> if there is a failure in
              finding valid tracks or if the user denies permission, as
              described below.</p>
              <p>When the <dfn>getUserMedia()</dfn> method is
              called, the User Agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

                  a promise <a>rejected</a> with a {{TypeError}}. The
                  word "optional" occurs in the WebIDL due to WebIDL rules, but
                  the argument MUST be supplied in order for the call to

      <h2>Implementation Suggestions</h2>
      <div class="practice">
        <span class="practicelab" id="resource-reservation">Resource
        reservation</span>
        <p class="practicedesc">The User Agent is encouraged to reserve
        resources when it has determined that a given call to
        {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} will be successful. It is preferable
        to reserve the resource prior to resolving the returned promise.
        Subsequent calls to {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}}
        (in this page or any other) should treat the resource that was
        previously allocated, as well as resources held by other applications,
        as busy. Resources marked as busy should not be provided as sources to
        the current web page, unless specified by the user. Optionally, the
        User Agent may choose to provide a stream sourced from a busy source
        but only to a page whose origin matches the owner of the original
        stream that is keeping the source busy.</p>
        <p class="practicedesc">This document recommends that in the permission
        grant dialog or device selection interface (if one is present), the
        user be allowed to select any available hardware as a source for the
        stream requested by the page (provided the resource is able to fulfill
        any specified <a>required constraints</a>). Although not specifically
        recommended as best practice, note that some User Agents may support
        the ability to substitute a video or audio source with local files and
        other media. A file picker may be used to provide this functionality to
        the user.</p>
        <p class="practicedesc">This document also recommends that the user be
        shown all resources that are currently busy as a result of prior calls
        to <a href="#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> (in this
        page or any other page that is still alive) and be allowed to terminate
        that stream and utilize the resource for the current page instead. If
        possible in the current operating environment, it is also suggested
        that resources currently held by other applications be presented and
        treated in the same manner. If the user chooses this option, the track
        corresponding to the resource that was provided to the page whose
        stream was affected must be removed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="practice">
        <dfn id="stored-permissions" class="practicelab">Stored
        Permission</dfn>s
        <p class="practicedesc">When permission is requested for a device, the
        User Agent may choose to store this permission for later use by the same origin, so that
        the user does not need to grant permission again at a later time.
        It is a User Agent choice whether it offers functionality to store
        permission to each device separately, all devices of a given class, or
        all devices; the choice needs to be apparent to the user, and
        permission must have been granted for the entire set whose permission
        is being stored, e.g., to store permission to use all cameras the user
        must have given permission to use all cameras and not just one.</p>
        <p class="practicedesc">As described, this specification does not
        dictate whether or not granting permission results in a stored
        permission. When permission is not stored, permission will last only
        until such time as all MediaStreamTracks sourced from that device have
        been stopped.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="practice">
        <span class="practicelab" id="handling-devices">Handling multiple
        devices</span>
        <p class="practicedesc">A <a>MediaStream</a> may contain more than one
        video and audio track. This makes it possible to include video from two
        or more webcams in a single stream object, for example. However, the
        current API does not allow a page to express a need for multiple video
        streams from independent sources.</p>
        <p class="practicedesc">It is recommended for multiple calls to
        <a href="#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> from the
        same page to be allowed as a way for pages to request multiple discrete
        video and/or audio streams.</p>
        <p class="practicedesc">Note also that if multiple <a href=
        "#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> calls are done by a
        page, the order in which they request resources, and the order in which
        they complete, is not constrained by this specification.</p>
        <p class="practicedesc">A single call to <a href=
        "#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> will always return
        a stream with either zero or one audio tracks, and either zero or one
        video tracks. If a script calls <a href=
        "#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia()</a> multiple times
        before reaching a stable state, this document advises the UI designer
        that the permission dialogs should be merged, so that the user can give
        permission for the use of multiple cameras and/or media sources in one
        dialog interaction. The constraints on each getUserMedia call can be
        used to decide which stream gets which media sources.</p>

      <div class="practice">
        <span class="practicelab" id="generating-deviceids">Generating deviceIds</span>
        <p class="practicedesc">An efficient practice for generating a
        {{MediaDeviceInfo/deviceId}} is to generate a cryptographic hash from
        a private key + (origin or origin + top-level origin, based on the user
        agents' partitioning rules) + salt + device's underlying (hardware) id
        in the driver, and present the resulting hash as an alphanumeric string.
        Using 32 bits or fewer for the hash is recommended, but not much lower,
        to avoid risk of collision.
        </p>
        <p class="practicedesc">A lower-entropy alternative, at the cost of
        storage, is to assign the numbers 0 through 255 randomly to each
        new device encountered for each origin or origin + top-level origin,
        based on the User Agent's partitioning rules, retiring the number that
        hasn't been seen the longest if numbers run out.</p>

      <div class="practice">
        <span class="practicelab" id="muting-devices">Device muting initiated by User Agent</span>
        <p class="practicedesc">A track sourced by a camera or microphone may be
        forcibly [= track/muted =] by a User Agent at any time, in order
        to manage a user's privacy. However, doing so may create web
        compatibility issues, as well as leak information about user activity, so
        caution is advised.
        </p>
        <p class="practicedesc">Best practice is to
        <a data-lt=muted>mute</a> a camera or microphone track in the following
        instances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>An OS-level event for which the User Agent already suspends media
            playback globally, but JavaScript is not suspended. The rationale is
            users may otherwise be surprised if capture were to continue in this

            If the OS-level event already causes frames to stop coming in
            on the track, then no new information of user activity is revealed
            by this. Even when this is not the case, revealing that capture is
            ending seems like a reasonable privacy tradeoff compared to

    <h2>Constrainable Pattern</h2>
    <p>The Constrainable pattern allows applications to inspect and adjust the
    properties of objects implementing it (the <dfn>constrainable
    object</dfn>). It is broken out as a separate set of definitions so that it
    can be referred to by other specifications. The core concept is the
    Capability, which consists of a constrainable property of an object and the
    set of its possible values, which may be specified either as a range or as
    an enumeration. For example, a camera might be capable of framerates (a
    property) between 20 and 50 frames per second (a range) and may be able to
    be positioned (a property) facing towards the user, away from the user, or
    to the left or right of the user (an enumerated set). The application can
    examine a constrainable property's supported Capabilities via the
    <code>getCapabilities()</code> accessor.</p>
    <p>The application can select the (range of) values it wants for an
    object's Capabilities by means of basic and/or advanced ConstraintSets and
    the <code>applyConstraints()</code> method. A ConstraintSet consists of the
    names of one or more properties of the object plus the desired value (or a
    range of desired values) for each property. Each of those property/value
    pairs can be considered to be an individual constraint. For example, the
    application may set a ConstraintSet containing two constraints, the first
    stating that the framerate of a camera be between 30 and 40 frames per
    second (a range) and the second that the camera should be facing the user
    (a specific value). How the individual constraints interact depends on
    whether and how they are given in the basic Constraint structure, which is
    a ConstraintSet with an additional 'advanced' property, or whether they are
    in a ConstraintSet in the advanced list. The behavior is as follows: all
    'min', 'max', and 'exact' constraints in the basic Constraint structure are
    together treated as the <a>required constraints</a>, and if it is not possible
    to satisfy simultaneously all of those individual constraints for the
    indicated property names, the User Agent MUST [= reject =] the returned
    promise. Otherwise, it must apply the required constraints. Next, it will
    consider any ConstraintSets given in the
    <code><a href="#dom-constraints-advanced">advanced</a></code> list, in the
    order in which they are specified, and will try to satisfy/apply each complete
    ConstraintSet (i.e., all constraints in the ConstraintSet together), but
    will skip a ConstraintSet if and only if it cannot satisfy/apply it in its
    entirety. Next, the User Agent MUST attempt to apply, individually, any
    'ideal' constraints or a constraint given as a bare value for the property
    (referred to as <a>optional basic constraints</a>).
    Of these properties, it MUST satisfy the largest number that it can, in any
    order. Finally, the User Agent MUST [= resolve =] the returned
    promise.</p>
    <div class="note">
      Any constraint provided via this API will only be considered if the given
      constrainable property is supported by the User Agent. JavaScript
      application code is expected to first check, via
      <code>getSupportedConstraints()</code>, that all the named properties
      that are used are supported by the User Agent. The reason for this is that
      WebIDL drops any unsupported names from the dictionary holding the
      constraints, so the User Agent does not see them and the unsupported names
      end up being silently ignored. This will cause confusing programming
      errors as the JavaScript code will be setting constraints but the User Agent
      will be ignoring them. User Agents that support (recognize) the name of a
      required constraint but cannot satisfy it will generate an error, while
      User Agents that do not support the constrainable property will not generate
      an error.
    </div>
    <p>The following examples may help to understand how constraints work. The
    first shows a basic Constraint structure. Three constraints are given, each
    of which the User Agent will attempt to satisfy individually. Depending
    upon the resolutions available for this camera, it is possible that not all
    three constraints can be satisfied at the same time. If so, the User Agent
    will satisfy two if it can, or only one if not even two constraints can be
    satisfied together. Note that if not all three can be satisfied
    simultaneously, it is possible that there is more than one combination of
    two constraints that could be satisfied. If so, the User Agent will
    choose.</p>
    <pre class="example">
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: {
    width: 1280,
    height: 720,
    aspectRatio: 3/2
  }
});
    </pre>
    <p>This next example adds a small bit of complexity. The ideal values are
    still given for width and height, but this time with minimum requirements
    on each as well as a minimum frameRate that must be satisfied. If it cannot
    satisfy the frameRate, width or height minimum it will [= reject =] the
    promise. Otherwise, it will try to satisfy the width, height, and
    aspectRatio target values as well and then [= resolve =] the promise.</p>
    <pre class="example">
try {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    video: {
      width: {min: 640, ideal: 1280},
      height: {min: 480, ideal: 720},
      aspectRatio: 3/2,
      frameRate: {min: 20}
    }
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.name != "OverconstrainedError") {
    throw error;
  }
  // Overconstrained. Try again with a different combination (no prompt was shown)
}
    </pre>
    <p>This example illustrates the full control possible with the Constraints
    structure by adding the 'advanced' property. In this case, the User Agent
    behaves the same way with respect to the required constraints, but before
    attempting to satisfy the ideal values it will process the 'advanced' list.
    In this example the 'advanced' list contains two ConstraintSets. The first
    specifies width and height constraints, and the second specifies an
    aspectRatio constraint. Note that in the advanced list, these bare values
    are treated as 'exact' values. This example represents the following: "I
    need my video to be at least 640 pixels wide and at least 480 pixels high.
    My preference is for precisely 1920x1280, but if you can't give me that,
    give me an aspectRatio of 4x3 if at all possible. If even that is not
    possible, give me a resolution as close to 1280x720 as possible."</p>
    <pre class="example">
try {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    video: {
      width: {min: 640, ideal: 1280},
      height: {min: 480, ideal: 720},
      frameRate: {min: 30},
      advanced: [
        {width: 1920, height: 1280},
        {aspectRatio: 4/3},
        {frameRate: {min: 50}},
        {frameRate: {min: 40}}
      ]
    }
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.name != "OverconstrainedError") {
    throw error;
  }
  // Overconstrained. Try again with a different combination (no prompt was shown)
}
    </pre>
    <p>The ordering of advanced ConstraintSets is significant. In the preceding
    example it is impossible to satisfy both the 1920x1280 ConstraintSet and
    the 4x3 aspect ratio ConstraintSet at the same time. Since the 1920x1280
    occurs first in the list, the User Agent will attempt to satisfy it first.
    Application authors can therefore implement a backoff strategy by
    specifying multiple advanced ConstraintSets for the same property. The
    application also specifies two more advanced ConstraintSets, the
    first asking for a frame rate greater than 50, the second asking for a
    frame rate greater than 40.
    If the User Agent is capable of setting a frame rate greater than 50, it
    will (and the subsequent ConstraintSet will be trivially satisfied).
    However, if the User Agent cannot set the frame rate above 50, it will
    skip that ConstraintSet and attempt to set the frame rate above 40.
    In case the User Agent cannot satisfy either of the two ConstraintSets, the
    'min' value in the basic ConstraintSet insists on 30 as a lower bound.
    In other words, the User Agent would fail altogether if it couldn't get a
    value over 30, but would choose a value over 50 if possible, then try for
    a value over 40.</p>
    <p>Note that, unlike basic constraints, the constraints within a
    ConstraintSet in the advanced list must be satisfied together or skipped
    together. Thus, {width: 1920, height: 1280} is a request for that specific
    resolution, not a request for that width or that height. One can think of
    the basic constraints as requesting an 'or' (non-exclusive) of the
    individual constraints, while each advanced ConstraintSet is requesting an
    'and' of the individual constraints in the ConstraintSet. An application
    may inspect the full set of Constraints currently in effect via the
    <code>getConstraints()</code> accessor.</p>
    <p>The specific value that the User Agent chooses for a constrainable
    property is referred to as a Setting. For example, if the application
    applies a ConstraintSet specifying that the frameRate must be at least 30
    frames per second, and no greater than 40, the Setting can be any
    intermediate value, e.g., 32, 35, or 37 frames per second. The application
    can query the current settings of the object's constrainable properties via
    the {{MediaStreamTrack/getSettings()}}
    accessor.</p>

      <h2>Interface Definition</h2>
      <p>Although this specification formally defines
      <dfn>ConstrainablePattern</dfn> as a WebIDL interface, it is actually a
      template or pattern for other interfaces and cannot be inherited directly
      since the return values of the methods need to be extended, something
      WebIDL cannot do. Thus, each interface that wishes to make use of the
      functionality defined here will have to provide its own copy of the
      WebIDL for the functions and interfaces given here. However it can refer
      to the semantics defined here, which will not change. See <a href=
      "#media-stream-track-interface-definition">MediaStreamTrack Interface
      Definition</a> for an example of this.</p>
      <p>This pattern relies on the <a>constrainable object</a> defining three
      internal slots:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>A <dfn data-dfn-for="constrainable object">[[\Capabilities]]</dfn> internal slot, initialized to a
          <code>Capabilities</code> dictionary describing the aggregate
          allowable values for each constrainable property exposed, as
          explained under
          <a href="#dom-capabilities">Capabilities</a>, or an empty dictionary
          if it has none.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A <dfn data-dfn-for="constrainable object">[[\Constraints]]</dfn> internal slot, initialized to an
          empty <code>Constraints</code> dictionary.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A <dfn data-dfn-for="constrainable object">[[\Settings]]</dfn> internal slot, initialized to a
          <code>Settings</code> dictionary describing the currently active
          settings values for each constrainable property exposed, as
          explained under <a href="#dom-settings">Settings</a>, or an empty
          dictionary if it has none.</p>

                <p>It is possible that the underlying hardware may not exactly
                map to the range defined for the constrainable property. Where
                this is possible, the entry SHOULD define how to translate and
                scale the hardware's setting onto the values defined for the
                property. For example, suppose that a hypothetical
                fluxCapacitance property ranges from -10 (min) to 10 (max), but
                there are common hardware devices that support only values of
                "off" "medium" and "full". The constrainable property
                definition might specify that for such hardware, the User Agent
                should map the range value of -10 to "off", 10 to "full", and 0
                to "medium". It might also indicate that given a ConstraintSet
                imposing a strict value of 3, the User Agent should attempt to
                set the value of "medium" on the hardware, and that
                {{getSettings()}} should return a
                fluxCapacitance of 0, since that is the value defined as
                corresponding to "medium".</p>

              <p>We define the <dfn data-export>fitness distance</dfn> between a

                  <p>If <var>constraintName</var> is not supported by the

                <li>
                  <p>If the constraint does not apply for this type of object,
                  the fitness distance is 0 (that is, the constraint does not

                  <p>If <var>constraintValue</var> is a boolean, but the

                  <var>constraintName</var> member [= map/exist | exists =] or
                  not, from the formula

                  member does [= map/exist | not exist=], the fitness distance

                </li>
                <li>If no ideal value is specified (<var>constraintValue</var>
                either contains no member named 'ideal', or, if bare values are

                <li>For all positive numeric constraints (such as
                height, width, frameRate, aspectRatio, sampleRate and
                sampleSize), the fitness distance is the result of the formula

              </ol>
              <p>More definitions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>We refer to each element of a ConstraintSet (other than the
                special term 'advanced') as a 'constraint' since it is intended
                to constrain the acceptable settings for the given property
                from the full list or range given in the corresponding
                Capability of the ConstrainablePattern object to a value that
                is within the range or list of values it specifies.</li>
                <li>We refer to the "effective Capability" C of an object O as
                the possibly proper subset of the possible values of C (as
                returned by getCapabilities) taking into consideration
                environmental limitations and/or restrictions placed by other
                constraints. For example given a ConstraintSet that constrains
                the aspectRatio, height, and width properties, the values
                assigned to any two of the properties limit the effective
                Capability of the third. The set of effective Capabilities may
                be platform dependent. For example, on a resource-limited
                device it may not be possible to set properties P1 and P2 both
                to 'high', while on another less limited device, this may be
                possible.</li>
                <li>A settings dictionary, which is a set of values for the
                constrainable properties of an object O, satisfies
                ConstraintSet CS if the <a>fitness distance</a> between the set
                and CS is less than infinity.
                </li>
                <li>A set of ConstraintSets CS1...CSn (n &gt;= 1) can be
                satisfied by an object O if it is possible to find a settings
                dictionary of O that satisfies CS1...CSn simultaneously.</li>
                <li>To apply a set of ConstraintSets CS1...CSn to object O is
                to choose such a sequence of values that satisfy CS1...CSn and
                assign them as the settings for the properties of O.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We define the <dfn data-export>SelectSettings</dfn> algorithm as
              follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Each <a>constraint</a> specifies one
                or more values (or a range of values) for its property. A
                property MAY appear more than once in the list of 'advanced'
                ConstraintSets. If an empty list has been given as the value
                for a constraint, it MUST be interpreted as if the constraint
                were not specified (in other words, an empty constraint == no
                constraint).
                  <p>Note that unknown properties are discarded by WebIDL,
                  which means that unknown/unsupported required constraints
                  will silently disappear. To avoid this being a surprise,
                  application authors are expected to first use the
                  {{MediaDevices/getSupportedConstraints()}} method as shown in the
                  Examples below.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Let <var>object</var> be the

                algorithm is applied. Let <var>copy</var> be an unconstrained
                copy of <var>object</var> (i.e., <var>copy</var> should behave
                as if it were <var>object</var> with all ConstraintSets

                      treating bare values of properties as exact.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>If the fitness distance is finite for one or more

                      those settings dictionaries in <var>candidates</var>,
                      discarding others.</p>
                      <p>If the fitness distance is infinite for all settings
                      dictionaries in <var>candidates</var>, ignore this

                  algorithm. The User Agent MUST use one with the smallest
                  <a>fitness distance</a>, as calculated in step 3. If more than
                  one settings dictionary have the smallest fitness distance,
                  the User Agent chooses one of them based on system default property values
                  and User Agent default property values.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>For any property with a system default value for the selected device, the system default value SHOULD
                be used if compatible with the above algorithm. This is usually the case for properties
                like <a href="#def-constraint-sampleRate">sampleRate</a> or <a href="#def-constraint-sampleSize">sampleSize</a>.
                Other properties, like <a href="#def-constraint-echoCancellation">echoCancellation</a> or
                <a href="#def-constraint-resizeMode">resizeMode</a> do not usually have system default values.
                The User Agent defines its own default values for these properties.
                Implementors need to be cautious to select good default values since they will often have
                an impact on how media content is generated.</p>
              <div class="note">
                <p>It is recommended to look at existing implementations to select meaningful default values.
                Note that default values may differ based on the system, for instance desktop vs. mobile.
                At time of writing, User Agent implementations tend to use the following default values,
                which were chosen for their suitability for using RTCPeerConnection as a sink:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><p><a href="#def-constraint-width">width</a> set to 640.</p></li>

      uses the <a href="#constrainable-properties">constrainable properties</a>
      defined for camera-sourced {{MediaStreamTrack}}s. In this example, all
      constraints are ideal values, which means results are "best effort" based
      on the user's specific camera:</p>
      <pre class="example">
await track.applyConstraints({
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
  frameRate: 30,
});
const {width, height, frameRate} = track.getSettings();

console.log(&#96;${width}x${height}x${frameRate}&#96;); // 1920x1080x30, or it might be e.g.
                                                // 1280x720x30 as best effort
      </pre>
      <p>For finer control, an application can insist on an exact match, provided
      it's prepared to handle failure:
      <pre class="example">
try {
  await track.applyConstraints({
    width: {exact: 1920},
    height: {exact: 1080},
    frameRate: {min: 25, ideal: 30, max: 30},
  });
  const {width, height, frameRate} = track.getSettings();

  console.log(&#96;${width}x${height}x${frameRate}&#96;); // 1920x1080x25-30!

} catch (error) {

    throw error;
  }
  console.log(&#96;This camera cannot produce the requested ${error.constraint}.&#96;);
}

      </pre>
      </p>
      <p>Constraints can also be passed into {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia}}, not
      just as an initialization convenience, but to influence device selection.
      In this case,
      [= list of inherent constrainable track properties | inherent constraints =]
      are also available.
      </p>
      <p>Here's an example of using constraints to prefer a specific
      camera and microphone from a previous visit, with requirements on
      dimensions and a preference for stereo, to be applied once granted, and to
      help find suitable replacements in case the requested devices are no
      longer available (or in some user agents, overriden by the user).</p>
      <pre class="example">
try {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({

      channelCount: 2
    }

  // Granted. Store deviceIds for next time
  localStorage.camId = stream.getVideoTracks()[0].getSettings().deviceId;
  localStorage.micId = stream.getAudioTracks()[0].getSettings().deviceId;

} catch (error) {

      <div class="note">
        <p>The above example avoids using <code>{exact: deviceId}</code>,

      <p>Here's an example asking for a back camera on a phone, ideally in 720p,
      but accepting anything close to that. Note how constraints on dimensions
      are specified in landscape mode:</p>
      <pre class="example">
async function getBackCamera() {
  return await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    video: {
      facingMode: {exact: 'environment'},
      width: 1280,
      height: 720
    }
  });
}
      </pre>
      <p>Here's an example of "I want a native 16:9 resolution near 720p, but
      with an exact frame rate of 10 even if not natively available". This needs
      to be done in two steps: One to discover the native mode, and a second
      step to apply the custom frame rate. This also shows how to derive
      constraints from current settings, which may be rotated:</p>
      <pre class="example">
async function nativeResolutionButDecimatedFrameRate() {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    video: {
      resizeMode: 'none', // means native resolution and frame rate
      width: 1280,
      height: 720,
      aspectRatio: 16 / 9 // aspect ratios may not be exactly accurate
    }
  });
  const [track] = stream.getVideoTracks();
  const {width, height, aspectRatio} = track.getSettings();

  // Constraints are in landscape, while settings may be rotated (portrait)
  if (width < height) {
    [width, height] = [height, width];
    aspectRatio = 1 / aspectRatio;
  }

  await track.applyConstraints({
    resizeMode: 'crop-and-scale',
    width: {exact: width},
    height: {exact: height},
    frameRate: {exact: 10},
    aspectRatio,
  });

  return stream;
}
      </pre>
      <div class="note">The above example assumes the <a>primary orientation</a>
      is landscape.</div>
      <p>Here's an example showing how to use
      {{MediaDevices/getSupportedConstraints}}, for cases where a constraint
      being ignored due to lack of support in a user agent is not tolerated by
      the application:
      <pre class="example">

  const supports = navigator.mediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints();

  for (const constraint of ["facingMode", "aspectRatio", "resizeMode"]) {
    if (!(constraint in supports) {
      throw new OverconstrainedError(constraint, "Not supported");
    }
  }
  return await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    video: {
      facingMode: {exact: 'user'},
      advanced: [
        {aspectRatio: 16/9, height: 1080, resizeMode: "none"},
        {aspectRatio: 4/3, width: 1280, resizeMode: "none"}

      <h2>Types for Constrainable Properties</h2>
      <p>The syntax for the specification of the set of legal values depends on
      the type of the values. In addition to the standard atomic types
      (boolean, long, double, DOMString), legal values include lists of any of
      the atomic types, plus min-max ranges, as defined below.</p>
      <p>List values MUST be interpreted as disjunctions. For example, if a
      property 'facingMode' for a camera is defined as having legal values
      ["left", "right", "user", "environment"], this means that 'facingMode'
      can have the values "left", "right", "environment", and "user". Similarly
      <a>Constraints</a> restricting 'facingMode' to ["user", "left", "right"]
      would mean that the User Agent should select a camera (or point the
      camera, if that is possible) so that "facingMode" is either "user",
      "left", or "right". This Constraint would thus request that the camera
      not be facing away from the user, but would allow the User Agent to allow
      the user to choose other directions.</p>

      <h3>Capabilities</h3>
      <p><dfn data-dfn-type=dictionary>Capabilities</dfn> is a dictionary containing one or more
      key-value pairs, where each key MUST be a constrainable property, and
      each value MUST be a subset of the set of values allowed for that
      property. The exact syntax of the value expression depends on the type of
      the property. The Capabilities dictionary specifies which constrainable
      properties that can be applied, as constraints, to the <a>constrainable
      object</a>. Note that the Capabilities of a <a>constrainable object</a>
      MAY be a subset of the properties defined in the Web platform, with a
      subset of the set values for those properties. Note that Capabilities are
      returned from the User Agent to the application, and cannot be specified
      by the application. However, the application can control the Settings
      that the User Agent chooses for constrainable properties by means of
      Constraints.</p>
      <p>An example of a Capabilities dictionary is shown below. In this case,
      the <a>constrainable object</a> is a video source with a very limited set
      of Capabilities.</p>
      <pre class="example">
{
  frameRate: {min: 1.0, max: 60.0},
  facingMode: ['user', 'left']
}
      </pre>
      <p>The next example below points out that capabilities for range values
      provide ranges for individual constrainable properties, not combinations.
      This is particularly relevant for video width and height, since the
      ranges for width and height are reported separately. In the example, if
      the <a>constrainable object</a> can only provide 640x480 and 800x600
      resolutions the relevant capabilities returned would be:</p>
      <pre class="example">
{
  width: {min: 640, max: 800},
  height: {min: 480, max: 600},
  aspectRatio: 4/3
}
      </pre>
      <p>Note in the example above that the aspectRatio would make clear that
      arbitrary combination of widths and heights are not possible, although it
      would still suggest that more than two resolutions were available.</p>A
      specification using the Constrainable Pattern should not subclass the
      below dictionary, but instead provide its own definition. See
      {{MediaTrackCapabilities}} for an example.

    <section>
      <h3>Settings</h3>
      <p><dfn>Settings</dfn> is a dictionary containing one or more key-value
      pairs. It MUST contain each key returned in
      <code>getCapabilities()</code> for which the property is defined on the
      object type it's returned on; for instance, an audio
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} has no "width" property. There MUST
      be a single value for each key and the value MUST be a member of the set
      defined for that property by <code>getCapabilities()</code>. The
      <code>Settings</code> dictionary contains the actual values that the User
      Agent has chosen for the object's constrainable properties. The exact
      syntax of the value depends on the type of the property.</p>
      <p>A conforming User Agent MUST support all the constrainable properties
      defined in this specification.</p>
      <p>An example of a Settings dictionary is shown below. This example is
      not very realistic in that a User Agent would actually be required to
      support more constrainable properties than just these.</p>
      <pre class="example">
{
  frameRate: 30.0,
  facingMode: 'user'
}
      </pre>A specification using the Constrainable Pattern should not subclass
the below dictionary, but instead provide its own definition. See {{MediaTrackSettings}} for an example.

      <h3><dfn>Constraints and ConstraintSet</dfn></h3>
      <p>Due to the limitations of WebIDL, interfaces implementing the
      Constrainable Pattern cannot simply subclass Constraints and
      ConstraintSet as they are defined here. Instead they must provide their
      own definitions that follow this pattern. See <a href=
      "#media-track-constraints">MediaTrackConstraints</a> for an example of
      this.</p>
      <div class=example>Template:
        <pre class="idl">dictionary ConstraintSet {};</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Each member of a <dfn>ConstraintSet</dfn> corresponds to a
      constrainable property and specifies a subset of the property's legal
      Capability values. Applying a ConstraintSet instructs the User Agent to
      restrict the settings of the corresponding constrainable properties to
      the specified values or ranges of values. A given property MAY occur both
      in the basic Constraints set and in the advanced ConstraintSets list, and
      MAY occur at most once in each ConstraintSet in the advanced list.</p>

              satisfied. The order of these ConstraintSets is significant. In
              particular, when they are passed as an argument to
              <code>applyConstraints</code>, the User Agent MUST try to satisfy
              them in the order that is specified. Thus if advanced
              ConstraintSets C1 and C2 can be satisfied individually, but not
              together, then whichever of C1 and C2 is first in this list will
              be satisfied, and the other will not. The User Agent MUST attempt
              to satisfy all ConstraintSets in the list, even if some cannot be
              satisfied. Thus, in the preceding example, if constraint C3 is
              specified after C1 and C2, the User Agent will attempt to satisfy
              C3 even though C2 cannot be satisfied. Note that a given property
              name may occur only once in each ConstraintSet but may occur in
              more than one ConstraintSet.</p>

    <h1 id="permissions-integration">Permissions Integration</h1>
    <p>This specification defines two [=powerful features=] identified by the
    [=powerful feature/names=] <code>"camera"</code> and <code>"microphone"</code>.</p>
    <p>It defines the following types and algorithms:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        [=powerful feature/permission descriptor type=]
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <pre class="idl">
          dictionary DevicePermissionDescriptor : PermissionDescriptor {
            DOMString deviceId;
          };

          dictionary CameraDevicePermissionDescriptor : DevicePermissionDescriptor {
            boolean panTiltZoom = false;
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          A permission covers access to the device given in the associated descriptor.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the descriptor does not have a {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}}, its
          semantic is that it queries for access to all devices of that class. Thus, if a query
          for the {{PermissionName/"camera"}} permission with no
          {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}} returns {{PermissionState/"granted"}}, the
          client knows that there will never be a permission prompt for a camera, and if
          {{PermissionState/"denied"}} is returned, it knows that no getUserMedia request for a
          camera will succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a permission state is present for access to some, but not all, cameras, a query
          without the {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}} will return
          {{PermissionState/"prompt"}}.
        </p>
        <p>
          `{name: "camera", panTiltZoom: true}` is [=PermissionDescriptor/stronger than=]
          `{name: "camera", panTiltZoom: false}`.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that a "granted" permission is no guarantee that getUserMedia will succeed. It
          only guarantees that the user will not be prompted for permission. There are many
          other things (such as constraints or the camera being in use) that can cause
          getUserMedia to fail.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        [=powerful feature/extra permission data type=]
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A list of {{MediaDeviceInfo/deviceId}} values for the devices the user has made a
        non-default decision on access to.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        [=powerful feature/permission query algorithm=]
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The permission query algorithm runs the following steps:
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>If |permissionDesc|.deviceId exists in the [=powerful feature/extra permission
          data=], set <code>|status|.state</code> to |permissionDesc|'s <a>permission state</a>
          and terminate these steps.
          </li>
          <li>Let <var>global</var> be a copy of |permissionDesc| with the
          {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}} member removed.
          </li>
          <li>Set <code>|status|.state</code> to <var>global</var>'s <a>permission state</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        [=powerful feature/permission revocation algorithm=]
      </dt>
      <dd>
        This is the result of calling the [=device permission revocation algorithm=] passing
        {{PermissionDescriptor/name}} and {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}} as arguments.
        If the descriptor does not have a {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}}, then
        <code>undefined</code> is passed in place of {{DevicePermissionDescriptor/deviceId}}.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1 id=permissions-policy-integration>Permissions Policy Integration</h1>
    <p>This specification defines two [=policy-controlled feature=]s
    identified by the strings
    <code><dfn>"camera"</dfn></code> and
    <code><dfn>"microphone"</dfn></code>.
    Both have a [=default allowlist=] of <code class=permissionspolicy>"self"</code>.
    <div class="note">
      <p>A [=document=]'s [=Document/permissions policy=]
      determines whether any content in that document is allowed to use
      {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia}} to request camera or microphone respectively. If
      disabled in any document, no content in the document will be [=allowed to use=]
      {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia}} to request the camera or microphone
      respectively. This is enforced by the [=request permission to use=]
      algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, {{MediaDevices/enumerateDevices}} will only enumerate devices
      the document is [=allowed to use=].</p>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Privacy Indicator Requirements</h1>
    <p>For each <var>kind</var> of device that {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} exposes,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define <var>any&lt;kind&gt;Accessible</var> (e.g.
      <var>anyAudioAccessible</var>, <var>anyVideoAccessible</var>) as the
      logical OR of the {{MediaDevices/[[kindsAccessibleMap]]}}<var>[kind]</var> value and all
      the {{MediaDevices/[[devicesAccessibleMap]]}}<var>[deviceId]</var> values for devices of
      that kind.</li>
      <li>Define any<var>&lt;kind&gt;Live</var> (e.g. <var>anyAudioLive</var>,
      <var>anyVideoLive</var>) to be the logical OR of the
      {{MediaDevices/[[kindsAccessibleMap]]}}<var>[kind]</var> value and all the
      {{MediaDevices/[[devicesLiveMap]]}}<var>[deviceId]</var> values for devices of that
      kind.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Define <var>anyAccessible</var> to be the logical OR of all
    <var>any&lt;kind&gt;Accessible</var> values.</p>
    <p>Define <var>anyLive</var> to be the logical OR of all
    <var>any&lt;kind&gt;Live</var> values.</p>
    <p>Then the following are requirements on the User Agent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The User Agent MUST indicate to the user when the value of
      <var>anyAccessible</var> changes.</li>
      <li>The User Agent MUST indicate to the user when the value of
      <var>anyLive</var> changes.</li>
      <li>If the User Agent provides indication to the user per
      <var>kind</var>, then for each <var>any&lt;kind&gt;Accessible</var> value
      and <var>any&lt;kind&gt;Live</var> value, it MUST at minimum indicate
      when the value changes.</li>
      <li>If the User Agent provides indication to the user per
      <var>device</var>, then for each
      {{MediaDevices/[[devicesAccessibleMap]]}}<var>[deviceId]</var> value and
      {{MediaDevices/[[devicesLiveMap]]}}<var>[deviceId]</var> value, it MUST at minimum
      indicate when the value changes.</li>
      <li>Any false-to-true transition indicated MUST remain observable for a
      sufficient time that a reasonably-observant user could become aware of
      it. This SHOULD be at least 3 seconds.</li>
      <li>Any of the above transition indications MAY be combined as long as
      the combined indication cannot transition to false if any of its
      component indications are still true.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and the following are encouraged behaviors for the User Agent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The User Agent is encouraged to provide ongoing indication of the
      current state of <var>anyAccessible</var>.</li>
      <li>The User Agent is encouraged to provide ongoing indication of the
      current state of <var>anyLive</var> and to make any generic hardware
      device indicator light match.</li>
      <li>If the User Agent provides indication to the user per
      <var>kind</var>, then for each any<var>&lt;kind&gt;Accessible</var> value
      and any<var>&lt;kind&gt;Live</var> value, it is encouraged to provide
      ongoing indication of the current state of the value. It is also
      encouraged to make any device-type-specific hardware indicator light
      match the corresponding any<var>&lt;kind&gt;Live</var> value.</li>
      <li>If the User Agent provides indication to the user per
      <var>device</var>, then for each
      {{MediaDevices/[[devicesAccessibleMap]]}}<var>[deviceId]</var> value and
      {{MediaDevices/[[devicesLiveMap]]}}<var>[deviceId]</var> value, it is encouraged to
      provide ongoing indication of the current state of the value. It is also
      encouraged to make any device-specific hardware indicator light match the
      corresponding {{MediaDevices/[[devicesLiveMap]]}}<var>[deviceId]</var> value.</li>
      <li>Any of the above ongoing indications MAY be used instead of the
      corresponding required transition indication provided the false-to-true
      transition requirement is met.</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h1>Privacy and Security Considerations</h1>
    <p>This section is non-normative; it specifies no new behavior, but instead
    summarizes information already present in other parts of the
    specification.</p>
    <p>This document extends the Web platform with the ability to manage input
    devices for media - in this iteration, microphones, and cameras. It also
    allows the manipulation of audio output devices (speakers and headphones).
    Capturing audio and video exposes personally-identifiable information to
    applications, and this specification requires obtaining explicit user
    consent before sharing it.</p>
    <p>Without authorization (to the "drive-by web"), it offers the ability to
    tell how many devices there are of each class, and how they are grouped
    together (e.g. a microphone and camera belonging to a single Web cam). The
    identifiers for the devices are designed to not be useful for a fingerprint
    that can track the user between origins, but the number and grouping of
    devices adds to the fingerprint surface. It recommends to treat the
    per-origin persistent identifier {{MediaDeviceInfo/deviceId}} as other persistent
    storage (e.g. cookies) are treated.</p>
    <p>When authorization is given, this document describes how to get access
    to, and use, media data from the devices mentioned. This data may be
    sensitive; advice is given that indicators should be supplied to indicate
    that devices are in use, but both the nature of authorization and the
    indicators of in-use devices are platform decisions.</p>
    <p>Authorization may be given on a case-by-case basis, or be persistent. In
    the case of a case-by-case authorization, it is important that the user be
    able to say "no" in a way that prevents the UI from blocking user
    interaction until permission is given - either by offering a way to say a
    "persistent NO" or by not using a modal permissions dialog.</p>
    <p>When authorization to any media device is given, application developers
    gain access to the labels of all available media capture devices. In most
    cases, the labels are persistent across browsing sessions and across
    origins that have also been granted authorization, and thus potentially
    provide a way to track a given device across time and origins.</p>
    <p>For origins to which permission has been granted, the
    <a data-link-type=event>devicechange</a> event will be emitted across browsing
    contexts and origins each time a new media device is added or removed; user
    agents can mitigate the risk of correlation of browsing activity across
    origins by fuzzing the timing of these events.</p>
    <p>Once a developer gains access to a media stream from a capture device,
    the developer also gains access to detailed information about the device,
    including its range of operating capabilities (e.g. available resolutions
    for a camera). These operating capabilities are for the most part
    persistent across browsing sessions and origins, and thus provide a way to
    track a given device across time and origins.</p>
    <p>Once access to a video stream from a capture device is obtained, that
    stream can most likely be used to fingerprint uniquely the said device
    (e.g. via dead pixel detection). Similarly, once access to an audio stream
    is obtained, that stream can most likely be used to fingerprint user
    location down to the level of a room or even simultaneous occupation of a
    room by disparate users (e.g. via analysis of ambient audio or of unique
    audio purposely played out of the device speaker). User-level mitigation
    for both audio and video consists of covering up the camera and/or
    microphone or revoking permission via User Agent chrome controls.</p>
    <p>It is possible to use constraints so that the failure of a getUserMedia
    call will return information about devices on the system without prompting
    the user, which increases the surface available for fingerprinting. The
    User Agent should consider limiting the rate at which failed getUserMedia
    calls are allowed in order to limit this additional surface.</p>
    <p>In the case of persistent authorization via a stored permission, it is
    important that it is easy to find the list of granted permissions and
    revoke permissions that the user wishes to revoke.</p>
    <p>Once permission has been granted, the User Agent should make two things
    readily apparent to the user:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>That the page has access to the devices for which permission is
      given</li>
      <li>Whether or not any of the devices are presently recording ("on air")
      indicator</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      <p>Developers of sites with stored permissions should be careful that
      these permissions not be abused. These permissions can be revoked using
      the [[permissions]] API.</p>
      <p>In particular, they should not make it possible to automatically send
      audio or video streams from authorized media devices to an end point that
      a third party can select.</p>
      <p>Indeed, if a site offered URLs such as
      <code>https://webrtc.example.org/?call=<var>user</var></code> that would
      automatically set up calls and transmit audio/video to
      <code><var>user</var></code>, it would be open for instance to the
      following abuse:</p>
      <p>Users who have granted stored permissions to
      <code>https://webrtc.example.org/</code> could be tricked to send their
      audio/video streams to an attacker <code>EvilSpy</code> by following a
      link or being redirected to
      <code>https://webrtc.example.org/?user=EvilSpy</code>.</p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Extensibility</h2>
    <p>Although new versions of this specification may be produced in the
    future, it is also expected that other standards will need to define new
    capabilities that build upon those in this specification. The purpose of
    this section is to provide guidance to creators of such extensions.</p>
    <p>Any WebIDL-defined interfaces, methods, or attributes in the
    specification may be extended. Two likely extension points are defining a
    new media type and defining a new constrainable property.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Defining a new media type (beyond the existing Audio and Video
      types)</h2>
      <p>At a minimum, defining a new media type would require</p>
      <ul>
        <li>adding a new getXXXXTracks() method for the type to the
        {{MediaStream}} interface,</li>
        <li>describing what a muted or disabled track of that type will render
        (see <a href="#life-cycle-and-media-flow"></a>),
        </li>
        <li>adding the new type as an additional legal value for the
        {{MediaStreamTrack/kind}} attribute on
        the {{MediaStreamTrack}} interface,</li>
        <li>defining any constrainable properties (see <a href=
        "#constrainable-properties"></a>) that are applicable to the media
        type,
        </li>
        <li>updating how the {{HTMLMediaElement}} works with a
          {{MediaStream}} containing a track of the new media type
          (see <a href="#mediastreams-in-media-elements"></a>), including
          adding a corollary to [= stream/audible =]/inaudible
          for the new media type,
        </li>
        <li>updating {{MediaDeviceKind}} if the new type has
        enumerable devices,</li>
        <li>updating the {{MediaStreamTrack/getCapabilities()}} and
        {{MediaDevices/getUserMedia()}} descriptions,</li>
        <li>adding the new type to the
        {{MediaStreamConstraints}} dictionary,</li>
        <li>describing any new security and/or privacy considerations (see
        <a href="#privacy-and-security-considerations"></a>) introduced by the
        new type, and
        </li>
        <li>if the new type requires user authorization, defining new
        permissions for it, including a new PermissionDescriptor name
        associated with the new {{MediaStreamTrack/kind}}, and defining how these
        permissions, along with access starting and ending, as well as
        muting/disabling, affect any new and/or existing "on-air" and "device
        accessible" indicator states (see <a href="#mediadevices">MediaDevices</a>).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, it should include updating</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <a>source</a> definition,
        </li>
        <li>the list of media stream <a>consumer</a>s,
        </li>
        <li>the description of the {{MediaStreamTrack/label}} attribute on the
        {{MediaStreamTrack}} interface,</li>
        <li>the list of sinks (see <a href=
        "#the-model-sources-sinks-constraints-and-settings"></a>), and
        </li>
        <li>the best practice statements referring to video and audio (see
        <a href="#implementation-suggestions"></a>).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It might also include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>explaining how the media is expected to be used by potential
        <a>consumer</a>s, and
        </li>
        <li>giving examples in {{MediaStreamTrackState}} of how
        such a track might become ended.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Defining a new constrainable property</h2>
      <p>This will require thinking through and defining how Constraints,
      Capabilities, and Settings for the property (see <a href=
      "#terminology"></a>) will work. The relevant text in
      {{MediaTrackSupportedConstraints}},
      {{MediaTrackCapabilities}},
      {{MediaTrackConstraints}},
      {{MediaTrackSettings}}, <a href=
      "#constrainable-properties"></a>, and
      {{MediaStreamConstraints}} are the model to use.</p>
      <p>Creators of extension specifications are strongly encouraged to notify
      the specification maintainers on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-main/issues">the specification repository</a>.<br>
      Future versions of this specification and others created by the WebRTC Working Group will take into consideration all extensions they are
      aware of in an attempt to reduce potential usage conflicts.</p>
    </section>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is also likely that new consumers of {{MediaStream}}s
    or {{MediaStreamTrack}}s will be defined in the future. The
    following section provides guidance.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Defining new consumers of {{MediaStream}}s and {{MediaStreamTrack}}s</h2>
      <p>At a minimum, any new consumer of a
      {{MediaStreamTrack}} will need to define</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how a {{MediaStreamTrack}} will render in the
        various states in which it can be, including muted and disabled (see
        <a href="#life-cycle-and-media-flow"></a>).
        </li>
      </ul>
